# Book Search Engine

## Description
This project was meant to take an existing search engine and update it to use modern technology (MERN Stack).  This is meant to convey a real life work situation in which you may be tasked to do exactly that.  Using Mongoose, Express, React, and Node, we now have a functional search engine that allows the user to signup and login to their profile.
